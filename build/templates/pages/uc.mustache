<h2>Where you live</h2>

<p>Universal Credit is being introduced in stages. Whether you can claim depends on where you live and your personal circumstances.</p>

<h2>Work while you claim Universal Credit</h2>

<p>There are no limits to the number of hours you can work a week if you receive Universal Credit. Your payment will reduce gradually as you earn more and you won’t lose all your benefits at once if you’re on a low income.</p>

<p>This is an agreement that you’ll complete certain tasks in order to claim Universal Credit. </p>

<p>What you agree to do will depend on things such as your health, your responsibilities at home and how much help you need to get work or increase your income.</p>
